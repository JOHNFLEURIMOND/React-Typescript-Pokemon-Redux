## My Awesome Project 

Your task is to take in a list of refrigerator contents and return a list containing weight by
category of expired contents to be composted. Below is a list of smell scores by category and
an example of refrigerator contents.
Category smell limits
‚óè Produce expires at an 8 or above
‚óè Dairy expires at a 5 or above
‚óè Meat expires at a 6 or above
Example refrigerator contents
1. 2.2 lbs of produce with a smell score of 0 (fresh)
2. 1.4 lbs of dairy with a smell score of 4 (fresh)
3. 1.5 lbs of produce with a smell score if 8 (expired)
4. 0.75 lbs of meat with a smell score of 6 (expired)
5. 0.55 lbs of snacks with a smell score of 9 (fresh)
6. 4.8 lbs of frozen with a smell score of 10 (expired)
7. 0.8 lbs of produce with a smell score of 10 (expired)
In this example, the contents should evaluate to
‚óè Meat: 0.75
‚óè Frozen: 4.8
‚óè Produce: 2.3


Write a function that can receive contents and return the total weight of each expired category.
Include some code that calls the function with the example input above and print the results.
